## Tests

Here are the different use cases which should work. Ideally, we should have a proper testing framework in place but 
before we have that, we can refer this guide to perform testing different use cases.

1. Follow Question
2. Unfollow Question
3. Follow User 
4. Unfollow User 

After performing all the above actions, we can verify from Settings Page
